    <h3>Best dry fruit sweet</h3>
    <p>Kaju katli is a popular dessert made in India with a heated dough of ground cashews, sugar, and cardamom.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients
    </h2>
    <ul style="font-size: 20px;">
        <li> 1 ½ cups cashews</li>

        <li>6 pods green cardamom</li>

        <li> ¾ cup white sugar</li>

        <li>6 tablespoons water</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon ghee (clarified butter), or as neede</li>
    </ul>

    <dl>
        <dt>
            <h2>Directions</h2>
        </dt>
        <dt style="font-weight: bold;">
            Step 1
        </dt>
        <dd>Blend cashews in a grinder just until they're in powder form. Don't overblend or they will start releasing
            their oil; we want the powder to remain dry.</dd>
        <dt style="font-weight: bold;">Step 2</dt>
        <dd>Remove green cardamom from the pods. Crush them into a powder with a mortar and pestle.</dd>
        <dt style="font-weight: bold;">Step 3</dt>
        <dd>Combine sugar and water in a nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Cook until sugar has completely dissolved,
            then bring to a boil. Lower the heat to medium and add cashew powder; stir thoroughly, making sure there are
            no lumps. Continue to cook and stir until it becomes a little thick.</dd>
        <dt style="font-weight: bold;">Step 4</dt>
        <dd>Add crushed cardamom powder and ghee; keep mixing and cooking until mixture thickens and starts separating
            from the sides of the pan. If it doesn't release from the pan, add some more ghee and mix again; it should
            look moist and sticky and not at all dry. Check to see if it's done by taking a spoonful and cooling it a
            bit; when you mold it into a ball and the texture is like fudge, it's done.</dd>
        <dt style="font-weight: bold;">Step 5</dt>
        <dd>Transfer mixture to a greased or parchment-lined plate and let cool until only slightly warm. Grease your
            palms and knead on parchment paper on a flat surface to form a very smooth dough, 2 to 3 minutes. Roll
            evenly to a thickness of 1/4 inch.</dd>
        <dt style="font-weight: bold;">Step 6</dt>
        <dd>Let rolled dough cool completely. Cut kaju katli into desired shapes. Serve at room temperature or cold.
